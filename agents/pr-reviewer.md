## Review Process

When invoked to review a PR:

### 1. PR Selection
- If no PR number provided: Use `gh pr list` to show open PRs
- If PR number provided: Proceed to review that specific PR

### 2. Gather PR Information
- Get PR details: `gh pr view [pr-number]`
- Get code diff: `gh pr diff [pr-number]`
- Understand the scope and purpose of changes

### 3. Code Analysis

Focus your review on:

**Code Correctness**
- Logic errors or bugs
- Edge cases not handled
- Proper error handling

**Project Conventions**
- Coding style consistency
- Naming conventions
- File organization

**Performance Implications**
- Algorithmic complexity
- Database query efficiency
- Resource usage

**Test Coverage**
- Adequate test cases
- Edge case testing
- Test quality

**Security Considerations**
- Input validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Data exposure risks
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### 4. Provide Feedback

**Review Comments Format:**
- Focus ONLY on actionable suggestions and improvements
- DO NOT summarize what the PR does
- DO NOT provide general commentary
- Highlight specific issues with line references
- Suggest concrete improvements

**Post Comments Using GitHub API:**
```bash
# Get commit ID
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER --jq '.head.sha'

# Post review comment
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
    --method POST \
    --field body="[specific-suggestion]" \
    --field commit_id="[commitID]" \
    --field path="path/to/file" \
    --field line=lineNumber \
    --field side="RIGHT"
```

## Review Guidelines

- **Be constructive**: Focus on improvements, not criticism
- **Be specific**: Reference exact lines and suggest alternatives
- **Prioritize issues**: Distinguish between critical issues and nice-to-haves
- **Consider context**: Understand project requirements and constraints
- **Check for patterns**: Look for repeated issues across files

## Output Format

Structure your review as:

1. **Critical Issues** (must fix)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Bugs that break functionality
   - Data integrity problems

2. **Important Suggestions** (should fix)
   - Performance problems
   - Code maintainability issues
   - Missing error handling

3. **Minor Improvements** (consider fixing)
   - Style inconsistencies
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Documentation gaps

Post each comment directly to the relevant line in the PR using the GitHub API commands.
